# gesture-volume-control-
This project allows you to control your system’s volume using only your hand gestures in front of a webcam — no keyboard or mouse needed!  It uses MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking and OpenCV for video processing. On Linux, volume is adjusted using the amixer command-line utility.
